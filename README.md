👋 Hi, I’m @MuscabKhalif
I’m passionate about technology and how it can transform the way we work, which is what led me to dive into the world of DevOps. My journey began with a curiosity for automation and efficiency, and it quickly evolved into a deep interest in building scalable, reliable systems. Through hands-on learning and problem-solving, I’ve developed a strong foundation in various DevOps practices and tools.
👀 I’m interested in:
•	Automating workflows and processes
•	Cloud infrastructure and container orchestration
•	Building reliable, scalable systems
•	Open-source DevOps tools and contributions
•	Continuous integration and delivery pipelines
🌱 I’m currently learning:
•	GitOps with ArgoCD and Flux: Leveraging GitOps principles to enhance infrastructure automation, streamline CI/CD pipelines, and ensure infrastructure as code is version-controlled and auditable.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
•	Open-source DevOps projects
•	Cloud-native applications and infrastructure
•	CI/CD pipeline optimization
•	Automating infrastructure provisioning and deployments
